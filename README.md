# Jmeter

Hi everyone,

This Selenium Jmeter script was created as a Final Project of the Udemy course: Learn JMETER from Scratch on Live Apps - Performance Testing, Teacher Rahul Shetty.

The Test Plan has 3 different websites, one type of thread for each. The websites are:
- the-internet.herokuapp.com
- blazedemo.com
- flashscore.com - the thread size is low due to not being a website for testing only purposes

It was used Jmeter functionalities/features such as:
- Jmeter Script Recorder
- HTTP Cookie Manager
- For analysis and debugging: View Results Tree, Aggregate Report, Assertion Results and Debug Result
- Different types of threads: Normal, Concurrency and Arrival
- Transaction Controllers
- CSV Data Set Config - for integration with external data
- Different Response Assertions for Code and Text whenever it is applicable
